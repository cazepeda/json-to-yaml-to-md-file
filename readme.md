# JSON to YAML to Markdown file Shell Script.

I created this script to help me convert all [Pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in/u:cazepeda) bookmarks in a format to allow me to import into my website. That format being YAML data saved in a Markdown file.

The script include comments for each line in case you need some explanation whats happening. Only dependency I used was [jq command-line JSON processor](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/). I used homebrew to install it.

I did write a bit more on this on [my website](https://czepeda.com/posts/json-to-yaml-to-markdown-file-shell-script).
